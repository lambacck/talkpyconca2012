    Hi, I'm Chris Lambacher and I deploy Python based web sites to windows
    servers. We have 31 python based web applications running on 1 windows
    server 2003 web server and 2 SQL server database boxes. In October we had
    648,000 unique visitors and 3.5 million page views. It's not the largest
    sites on the web, but not the smallest either.

                    In my case I have a large legacy application that is slowly

                    into it from VBScript. Catch me in the halls if you want to

                Before you start on deployment you need an application. I can't
                believe the number of people who come into IRC and ask about
                deployment specifics before writing one line of code for their
                app.  But I agree, deployment is much more interesting than
                whatever they are supposed to be getting done.

            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
                There are two kinds of web servers for us to discuss, front end
                and WSGI. Depending on your deployment strategy you may not
                need a separate WSGI server because you will use WSGI embedded
                in your front end server.

                Apache and IIS are the big fish for front end web servers on
                Windows.<br><br>NGINX is big on Posix systems and there is some
                kind of port in progress, but it is not ready for prime time.
                You may have constraints that dictate which one of these you
                can pick. I used to recommend Apache, but in IIS 7 and later things
                significantly better. We're running Windows server 2003 so only
                have IIS 6, we run Apache up front and Reverse Proxy back to
                IIS and Python apps.

                If your font end server reverse proxies, that is generates a
                new http request, back to your python application for your
                dynamic content, then you'll want one of these guys. I supposed
                Django has a development server too, I just don't know anything about Django.
                Paste was the default server Pylons/Pyramid/Turbogears 2 frameworks,
                but it does not have Python 3 support and I don't think anyone is going to
                step up to provide it. Waitress is the development server that comes with Pyramid 
                since Pyramid grew Python 3 support. Though we used Pyramid, we still use the Paste server.
                CherryPy has a well regarded WSGI server. Twisted also has a good
                WSGI server that can push tasks back to a thread pool so it looks like any of these other servers.

                <br>
                Then there are the non-Windows compatible very popular servers.
                These things use fork and signals to do the nice things the do.
                It's a pitty I can't use them, they look nifty.

                        If you wanted to do in server with IIS 7 you would need
                        to handle how it by default creates a user per
                        application pool and make sure the users have access to
                        your app, virtualenvs, etc

                        We run 30ish sites on one box and get enough traffic
                        that Apache can no-longer do a graceful shut down. We
                        can update and restart one app at a time because they
                        all have separate services rather than being all in Apache.

                        IIS Needs some more help. If you are on IIS 7+ there are extensions from Microsoft that can be bent into a reverse proxy setup.

                        If you are using an older IIS or just like the solution
                        better, you can use the open source Ionic's Isapi
                        Rewrite Filter which also has reverse proxy.
                        HeliconTech also has a bunch of for pay options. If
                        IIRF did reverse proxy when we set up these boxes, I
                        might have picked it over Apache.

                        I did some early testing with ISAPI-WSGI and it seemed
                        to work. It is based on the ISAPI support in Pywin32.
                        PyISAPIe is supposed to be focused around speed (aren't
                        we all) but I don't know that it is quite as straight
                        forward to configure.

                        iiswsgi is new (like 2 weeks new) and looks very
                        promising if you happen to be running IIS 7+. It uses 
                        the IIS 7 built in FastCGI support so gives you an
                        external process controlled by IIS. (Now we can feel
                        cool like the PHP kids).

                        If you are working with a reverse proxy or no front end
                        web server (yes you can do that). Then you'll probably
                        want your application to start with the computer.
                        That's handle on Windows by services. You can create
                        your own services in python with PyWin32. WsgiSvc is a
                        convenient wrapper (or at least starting point) for paste-deploy
                        based apps that you want to run in a Windows service. I'm running 
                        a modified version.

                        You can also wrap a command line app with srvany or
                        srvstart. Srvany is from Microsoft srvstart is much more 
                        powerful allow separate commands for the start and stop
                        events.

                        It seems like people who start on a posix system think
                        that fork is the solution to every daemon problem.
                        Python has subprocess to manage new processes in a way
                        that works cross-platform. I'd also like to see people try to 
                        use multiprocessing, but my attempts ended in failure do to 
                        problems with Python 2 and passing sockets to other processes.
                        That seems to be fixed in Python 3 so, there's hope for the future.

                        There have been a bunch of people beating the use pip
                        drum for installing packages. They are not wrong,
                        except that they are. As soon as you need a C extension
                        you run into problems because pip only installs from
                        source so you need a compiler.
                        <br><br>
                        Many python developers don't know anything about C and
                        compilers and linkers. And trying to give them succinct instructions about
                        getting those things installed on Windows in the right version for their
                        particular installed version of python. Oh and installing visual studio
                        on a production server. It's madness. Better stick to easy_install,
                        it will work with the pre-compiled version that the extension writer
                        has for download and you won't have to think about it any more.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        virtualenv is a nice way to get virtual python
                        environments so that you can keep apps with different
                        dependencies from stepping on each others toes. You
                        should use them. They are even nicer with virtualenvwrapper
                        which gives a bunch of helpers for activating, creating, deleting
                        and otherwise managing environments really easy. The orriginal
                        virtualenvwrapper is bash scripts so not very useful from 
                        the Windows command prompt, but there are a couple of ports,
                        one to batch scripts, virtualenvwrapper-win, and one to powershell,
                        virtualenvwrapper-powershell.
                        <br><br>
                        Also, you can activate a virtualenv from running code, you want to do it as early as possible
                        in the lifetime of your application, but you can do it for instance when your pywin32 based
                        service starts up. It is the activate_this script and is in the docs for virtualenv.
                        It also works within classic asp if you are so inclined.

                        Caching and sessions see a lot of storage in memory
                        based key value stores. The most common of these are
                        Memcached and Redis.  You can get memcached installed
                        when you install the community version of couchbase and
                        it comes with a nice monitoring app, but I found that
                        the memcached libraries that were compatible with
                        Windows masked connection errors with key not found
                        (i.e. None). If you have a reasonably high amount of traffic
                        you want a connection pool.
                        Redis clients have a connection pool, but there is no production ready redis
                        port for Windows. Our solution was to put Redis in
                        Linux on a VM (dirty secret, the host is also the web
                        box and we don't notice the load, it is 1 or 2 percent under heavy load)
