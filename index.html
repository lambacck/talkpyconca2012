    Hi, I'm Chris Lambacher, and I deploy Python-based web sites to Windows
    servers. We currently support 31 python-based web applications running on
    one windows server 2003 R2 machine. The audience of the sites is primarily
    Canadian, and in October we had 648,000 unique visitors and 3.5 million
    page views.

                    In my case, I have a large legacy application that is
                    slowly being ported from Classic ASP and VBScript. The
                    fully-ported part is now a Pyramid application, but there
                    is still a large body of code in Classic ASP. We have
                    managed to configure the application to use a common Python
                    library shared between the Classic ASP and Pyramid-based
                    parts that handles things like security and overall page

                You might think it was obvious, but before you start on
                deployment you need an application. A surprising number of
                people venture into the Pyramid IRC channel to ask about
                deployment specifics before one line of code has been written.
                It must be because deployment is just so darn fun. Part of the
                motivation for positioning your deployment cart in front of
                your horse application may be concern about what is and is not
                possible.  So yes &mdash; deployment to Windows IS possible.

                <li>Reverse Proxy</li>

            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
                There are two main deployment strategies: Embed in the Web
                Server, and Reverse Proxy. Embed in the Web Server is the
                PHP-type model, where your app runs as part of a big web server
                like Apache. The Reverse Proxy strategy is where Apache
                generates a new HTTP request to your app when it gets a request
                that maps to one of your dynamic pages.
                <br><br>
                If you have a low traffic intranet site, you may be able to get away with just
                exposing your development server to the web &mdash; but this is not recommended.

                <li>WSGI</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
                There are two kinds of web servers for us to discuss: The first is a front end
                server, like Apache or IIS; The second is what I'll call a WSGI server, for
                lack of a better name. A WSGI server will let you run your application and accept
                reverse- proxied requests. These are similar to, and in some
                cases may actually be, your development server.

            <h3>Front End</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>IIS</li>
                <li>Apache</li>
                <li class="fragment" style="text-decoration: line-through;">NGINX</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
                Apache and IIS are the big fish for front end web servers on
                Windows.
                <br><br>Although NGINX is popular on POSIX systems, the
                in-process port to Windows does not yet appear ready for prime
                time.
                <br><br>
                You may have constraints that dictate which of these you can
                pick. I used to recommend Apache because of the included bells
                and whistles, but in IIS 7 and later things got significantly
                better on the IIS front. We're running Windows server 2003 and
                only have IIS 6, so we run Apache up front and Reverse Proxy
                back to IIS and Python apps.

                Here are a few examples of WSGI servers. Any one of these may
                work for you in a reverse proxy deployment model. If your
                framework (cough Django) uses something different, that could
                work too. 
                <br><br>

                Paste used to be the default server for the Pylons, Pyramid and
                Turbogears 2 frameworks, but it does not have Python 3 support.
                Waitress is the development server that ships with Pyramid ever
                since Pyramid grew Python 3 support. 
                <br><br>
                CherryPy has a well-regarded server of this type. Twisted also
                has a good WSGI server that can push requests back to a thread
                pool so that it looks like any of these other servers. 
                <br><br>
                There are a number of other popular options out there in this
                space that are not Windows compatible. They use fork and
                signals to do the nice things they do. It's a pity I can't use
                them - they look nifty.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        In some ways, in-server deployment is the easy way, but no web server comes
                        with Python and WSGI support built in. I think the big win for this model is
                        process and communication management.
                        <br><br>
                        This model may offer lower communication overhead because a HTTP connection
                        does not need to be made to another process, unless you are using FastCGI, in
                        which case you are doing another form of interprocess communication, so
                        arguments can be made either way about which is better.

                        mod_wsgi is the tool to use in-process with Apache, with a few caveats. The
                        biggest let down is that Daemon mode, the ability to run your application in an
                        external process, isn't available on Windows. Each site does have its own
                        python interpreter, so you shouldn't have to fight another site for the GIL
                        (Sorry for invoking the G word!).

                        ISAPI-WSGI is based on the ISAPI support in Pywin32, and is reasonably easy to
                        configure. PyISAPIe is supposed to be focused around speed (aren't we all) but
                        I don't know that it is quite as straight forward to configure.

                        you an external process controlled by IIS. (Now we can feel cool like the PHP
                        kids).

                            IIS on the other hand, needs some help. If you are
                            on IIS 7 or later, there are extensions from
                            Microsoft that can be bent into a reverse proxy
                            setup. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are using an older version of IIS, or just
                            like the solution better, you can use the open
                            source Ionic's Isapi Rewrite Filter which also has
                            reverse proxy. HeliconTech also has for-pay
                            options.

                            there are other options if these don't appeal to
                            you.

                            If you are working with a reverse proxy or running your
                            development server and you want your application to
                            start along with the server, then you need a service.

                        <p>
                            You can create your own services in python with
                            PyWin32. WsgiSvc is a convenient wrapper (or at
                            least starting point) for paste-deploy based apps
                            that you want to run in a Windows service.

                            srvstart. Srvany is from Microsoft. srvstart is
                            much more powerful, and allows separate commands
                            for start and stop events.

                            Many people beat the “use pip” drum for installing
                            packages. They are not wrong, except that they are.
                            As soon as you need a C extension, you run into
                            problems because pip only installs from source so
                            you need a compiler. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some python developers don't know anything about C
                            and compilers and linkers. Trying to give them
                            succinct instructions about getting those things
                            installed on Windows in the right version for their
                            particular installed version of Python is hard. Oh, and
                            installing Visual Studio on a production server.
                            It's madness. Better stick to easy_install: it will
                            "just work" with the pre-compiled version that the
                            package author provided, even the windows installer
                            exes.

                            py2exe can be finicky with eggs (that's what

                        virtualenv helps you to keep apps with different
                        dependencies from stepping on each other’s toes through
                        the creation of virtual python environments. You should
                        use them. They are even nicer with virtualenvwrapper,
                        which provides a bunch of helpers that make activating,
                        creating, deleting and otherwise managing environments
                        really easy. The original virtualenvwrapper is in bash
                        scripts - so not very useful from the Windows command
                        prompt. Luckily there are a couple of ports, one to
                        batch scripts, and one to PowerShell.
                        <br><br>
                        You can also use activate_this to enable a virtualenv
                        from running code. Run it as early as you can after
                        your process starts, for instance when your pywin32 based
                        service first starts up, and make sure it is run before
                        importing the rest of your application.

                        Caching and sessions are often stored in memory-based key value stores, most
                        commonly Memcached and Redis. You can get Memcached installed when you install
                        the community version of Couchbase, and it comes with a nice monitoring app,
                        but I found that the Memcached libraries that were compatible with Windows
                        masked connection errors with key not found (i.e. None). If you have a
                        reasonably high amount of traffic, you want a connection pool. Redis clients
                        have a connection pool, but there is no production-ready Redis port for
                        Windows. After Memcached became overwhelmed by our increasing traffic load, our
                        solution was to put Redis in Linux on a VM. A dirty little secret: the host is
                        also the web box, and the load is insignificant at only 1 or 2 percent CPU
                        under heavy traffic.
